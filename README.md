HilbertCuts
===========

Various files for calculating Hilbert bases of cuts of graphs.

Instructions:

1. matrix.txt is incidence matrix of graph


2. use forloop.cpp to fill in code for code.cpp. There should be as many nested for loops as the number of vertices of the graph.
Fill in correct values for a and b in code.cpp


3. use code.cpp to generate cuts
Compile and run code.cpp -> outputs char vectors of cuts into graph.in


4. Use Normaliz to find Cone and Hilbert basis.

To use Normaliz
Download the basic package and executables in the same folder.

From the terminal go to the correct folder and type "java -jar jNormaliz.jar".

Open the file graph.in
